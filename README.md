# Market-Scenario-Analysis-and-Predictive-Modelling
Overview

This project focuses on performing financial analysis, modeling, and optimization on a sample portfolio containing four major stocks: Apple Inc. (AAPL), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). It provides insights into how macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates and unemployment rates, impact stock returns. Additionally, the project offers predictive modeling to forecast stock prices and a tool for portfolio optimization.
Key Features:
1. Scenario Analysis

    Interest Rate Impact: Simulate the effect of interest rate changes on stock prices using historical data.
    Macroeconomic Events: Explore the effects of macroeconomic events, like recessions, on the portfolio.

2. Predictive Modeling

    ARIMA Forecasting: Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA for predicting future stock prices.
    Model Evaluation: Evaluation of the model's performance on a testing dataset.

3. Factor Analysis

    Regression Insights: Regression analysis to understand how various factors impact the portfolio.

4. Sensitivity Analysis

    Portfolio Movements: Analyze the sensitivity of the portfolio to movements in individual stocks or market factors.

5. Optimization Tool

    Risk Parity Strategy: Portfolio optimization using the Risk Parity strategy to suggest potential rebalancing techniques to minimize risk.

6. Interactive Visualizations

    User Input: Allows users to input their own portfolio weights.
    Risk Parity Optimization: Displays the optimized portfolio based on the Risk Parity strategy.
    Cumulative Returns Visualization: Shows the cumulative returns for both the user-input portfolio and the optimized portfolio over the dataset's timeframe.
