Financial Portfolio Optimization and Analysis
Overview

This project focuses on performing financial analysis, modeling, and optimization on a sample portfolio containing four major stocks: Apple Inc. (AAPL), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). It provides insights into how macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates and unemployment rates, impact stock returns. Additionally, it offers predictive modeling to forecast stock prices and a tool for portfolio optimization.
Key Features:

    Scenario Analysis:
        Simulate the effect of interest rate changes on stock prices using historical data.
        Explore the effects of macroeconomic events, like recessions, on the portfolio.

    Predictive Modeling:
        Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA for predicting future stock prices.
        Evaluation of the model's performance on a testing dataset.

    Factor Analysis:
        Regression analysis to understand how various factors impact the portfolio.

    Sensitivity Analysis:
        Analyze the sensitivity of the portfolio to movements in individual stocks or market factors.

    Optimization Tool:
        Risk Parity portfolio optimization to suggest potential rebalancing techniques to minimize risk.

    Interactive Visualizations:
        Allows users to input their own portfolio weights.
        Displays the optimized portfolio based on the Risk Parity strategy.
        Shows the cumulative returns for both the user-input portfolio and the optimized portfolio over the dataset's timeframe.
